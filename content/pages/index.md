  description:
    - paragraph: Anei au, to pou whirinaki - I’m here, I’ll support you.
    - paragraph: My passion is to support women and their partner through pregnancy, birth and the transition to caring for a new baby. I have a focus on being authentic, connected and relational. My hope is that I can bring a calm gentle presence to your labour and/or postnatal experience by providing support that is specifically catered towards your needs. I have experience with home and hospital births and am comfortable using a number of different pain relief techniques including acupressure, TEN's machine and massage. As a doula I only provide emotional and physical support that is non-medical. I am committed to working alongside Midwifes and supporting them in their role, recognising they are responsible and skilled at making all medical decisions.
    - paragraph: I really want to take the time to get to know you so I can provide you with the best care possible.
