Tihei Mauri ora!

Nō Aerani, me Kōtirana me Hōrana me Ingarani ōku tupuna.

Kei te whanganui-a-tara e noho ana ahau.

Ko Joel tōku hoa tane

Ko Ania, me Raz, me Siân, me Roscoe, me Judah āku tāmariki

Ko Kate tōku ingoa

I love creation, people, women, babies, birth, parenting, and all the wonders that come when these things collide. I’m a wife to Joel, my best friend and forever companion. Together we have five beautiful Children who fill me with joy every day and have taught me most of what I know.

I’m a Pakeha and love the land of Aotearoa, it is the place I have deep roots going back many generations. I acknowledge that I can call Aotearoa home because of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the welcome of Tangata Whenua and I seek to honour the place of Maori in this land.

Wellington has been my home for my whole life and I love living and serving in this place.

Anei au, to pou whirinaki - I’m here, I’ll support you.

My passion is to support women and their partner through pregnancy, birth and the transition to caring for a new baby. I have a focus on being authentic, connected and relational. My hope is that I can bring a calm gentle presence to your labour and/or postnatal experience by providing support that is specifically catered towards your needs. I have experience with home and hospital births and am comfortable using a number of different pain relief techniques including acupressure, TEN's machine and massage. As a doula I only provide emotional and physical support that is non-medical. I am committed to working alongside Midwifes and supporting them in their role, recognising they are responsible and skilled at making all medical decisions.

I really want to take the time to get to know you so I can provide you with the best care possible.
